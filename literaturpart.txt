Generally, nowadays, the increasing threat to the computer system and the information they store and process are valuable resources that need to be protected. Authentication refers to the techniques where users must prove the claim of their identity to the identifier. There are many techniques which user can be authenticated. Some password authentication techniques are text passwords and sending a notification in the userâ€™s email to discover that their application is being hacked. The primary purpose of this project is to prevent shoulder-surfing attacks, key-logger exploitation, and password cracking issues by using an adaptation of one-password authentication. This project is also evaluated and compared to demonstrate the security strength and robustness.
	Using a password is a common practice for user authentication. Users need to memorize the password, and it can still be considered safe as long as only the users know the password. However, in reality, the passwords cannot always be kept safely as the human brain cannot manage passwords for many services at once (Erdem & Sandikkaya, 2019). A text password is a secret password or string of characters used for user authentication to prove the identity or for access approval to gain access to a resource. The easier a password is for the owner to remember generally means it will be easier for an attacker to guess. However, passwords that are difficult to remember may also reduce the security of a system. Because users might need to write down or electronically store the password, users will need frequent password resets, and users are more likely to reuse the same password. Unfortunately, intruders break these passwords mercilessly by several simple means: masquerading, eavesdropping, shoulder-surfing, and social engineering attacks.
	Therefore, thus project will implement a one-time password authentication during the user login to the application. 
2.2	One-Time Password
One-Time Password (OTP) authentication is a security mechanism designed to enhance the protection of user accounts and sensitive information generating unique, temporary passwords for each login attempt. This method is a significant improvement over static passwords, which are susceptible to various cyber-attacks such as phishing, key-logging, and password reuse. OTPs are typically implemented in two primary forms: Time-based OTPs (TOTP) and Event-based OTPs (HOTP). TOTPs combine a secret key with the current timestamp to produce a password that is valid only for a short duration, usually 30 or 60 seconds, thereby limiting the window of opportunity for attackers.
OTPs are increasingly integrated into multi-factor authentication (MFA) systems, which require users to provide multiple forms of verification before gaining access. This approach leverages something the user knows (a password), something the user has (an OTP), and sometimes something the user is (biometric data). By combining these factors, MFA significantly enhances the security of user accounts and sensitive data, making unauthorized access exponentially more difficult for cybercriminals.
