Nakkeeran (2015) states that the proliferation of networked devices and internet services has led to concerns regarding the security of data stored on desktop computers. Bawa(2012) suggests that traditional computing methods rely on portable storage media and machine robustness for security, whereas cloud computing offers a distributed environment with enhanced security features. Alshsayeji et al. (2018) highlight the importance of addressing reliability issues in cloud computing systems, as service outages can result from failures, which can affect the reliability and availability of cloud services. Kalanirnika and Sivagami (2015) propose proactive fault tolerance policies to predict and replace faults before they occur, ensuring the continuous operation of cloud computing systems. Deng et al. (2012) emphasize the need for reliable fault tolerance techniques in cloud computing, particularly for scientific computations where accuracy and dependability are critical. Paul and Visuswasm (2012) introduce a smart checkpoint infrastructure for cloud service providers to enhance fault tolerance in real-time computing scenarios. Guler and Ozkasap (2017) develop compressed incremental checkpointing algorithms to reduce communication costs and improve throughput in replicated key-value stores deployed on cloud infrastructure. Sutaria et al. (2017) conduct a comprehensive survey on fault prediction and mitigation techniques in cloud computing, highlighting the importance of proactive measures to enhance system reliability. 
In light of this findings, it is evident that ensuring the security and reliability of data stored on desktop computers, particularly in cloud-based environments, required robust fault tolerance mechanisms.
